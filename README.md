# 🧹 Node.js File Purge Automation

A lightweight, production-ready **Node.js automation script** designed to monitor specific directories (like logs, temp files, or downloads) and automatically delete files that exceed a defined age limit.

## 🚀 Features

* **Smart Cleanup:** Automatically calculates file age and removes expired data.
* **Path Safety:** Uses absolute path resolving to avoid errors across different OS environments.
* **Zero Dependencies:** Built using native Node.js modules (`fs`, `path`).
* **Highly Configurable:** Easily change the target folder and the expiration threshold (days).
